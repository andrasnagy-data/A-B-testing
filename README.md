## A/B Test 

### Scenario: Decision between 2 different versions of email (A and B) - Maximizing click-through rate

**Metric of choice: click-through-rate**

Conducted an experiment with a sample size of 1000. The 2 websites were shown and the click-through rate was measured.
The contingency table is shown below:

The data was analyzed using a Bayesian and a Frequentist approach. As it was the case, that only 2 variants were tested, I also used a proportion Z-test.
